# 36. Valid Sudoku
### portal: [Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/)
## Problem Description

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

- Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
- Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, but with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8.
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
